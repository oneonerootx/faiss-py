# faiss-py

This is a python implementation of [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for understanding the implementation of `faiss` without needing to understand C++.

From the faiss wiki:

> Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers for Python (versions 2 and 3). Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. It is developed primarily at Meta AI Research with help from external contributors.
